A java-kotlin template for creating your own android APPS in android studio  
 
 
  
WHAT-THIS-IS:   This template doesnt include Jetpack however compileSdk has been updated to 35 and the code has been cleaned.
   and the template is fully functional december 2024
   
HOWTO:  All you need to do is install android studio, and open this template.

DESCRIPTION: There are two templates.   The first  template doesnt have code yet, but will allow you to install the app on
the android device, everything has been prepared for you to do so.  This is difficult to setup, so i have done it for you.
You will see the app installs, on the android , and when it runs it will simply crash because it does not contain code.
But you get to install it.  

The second template will allow you to install the app on any android, and has running code: you will see the app is able
to launch a website after, a button is clicked from within the app.  This is a very simple code, to showcase how to program 
in android studios.  I created this template for the people who struggle learning java and kotlin.

Do whatever you want with this, you may freely distribute
